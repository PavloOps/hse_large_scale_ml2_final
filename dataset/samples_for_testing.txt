Case: 1
Predicted: Negative
Ground truth: Positive

This powder tasted ok nothing special about it. It’s really too early to say if
it actually does to me what it says it does as I only received 5 days worth of
powder. My review can not be completed at this time but feel like I could be
inclined to purchase.

Case: 2
Predicted: Negative
Ground truth: Negative

I’m disappointed. It does make my face look fresh, but doesn’t remove
blackheads. I bought it because it states in the name that it clears pores. Not
what I expected for this price. It is a nice texture though.

Case: 3
Predicted: Negative
Ground truth: Positive

I don’t understand how this product is so hyped. I love how it feels and the 40
SPF. The big downfall is that I have very dry skin, I get eczema on my body and
face. This sunscreen converted my face Into the most oilest land field out
there. I started setting it with powder and within two hours I was so oily.
Let’s not even talk about it under foundation. It became embarrassing when my
family and friends started asking me if I was okay because I looked so “sweaty”.
I would only use a pea size. Never again

I received a free sample of this and I fell in love with it! Goes on so
smooth,very silky. Doesn’t take a lot to cover face either. Was able to use
three times(sample) and it left my skin feeling lushous and plump. Will
definitely be purchasing a full size!

Case: 5
Predicted: Positive
Ground truth: Positive

I received this product complimentary from Influenster. I liked this product. It
made my skin feel very soft and smooth. It feels a little balm-y before it
dries, but once it does (and it dries very quick) it feels great. Expensive but
worth the investment.

Case: 6
Predicted: Negative
Ground truth: Positive

I have so many acne marks on my forehead and I was really excited to try this
product hoping it would make the texture of my skin better, but it didn’t work
for me. it didn’t do anything at all and I used it as instructed.

Case: 7
Predicted: Positive
Ground truth: Positive

Best makeup remover EVER!! I got the sweet apple one and can not recommend it
enough. This is the first makeup remover that actually gets rid of all my makeup
and it is so easy to use. For the first time ever I don’t wake up with black
stains under my eyes from leftover mascara, and the impact on my lashes from
rubbing the makeup off is soooo much less than before. I would recommend rinsing
your face with warm water once you are done and applying serum since it can feel
like it leaves your face a little oily but it is purely mental I have realized.
So if you are a freak like me about leaving anything on your face just rinse it.
You won’t regret buying it.

My blackheads do look smaller so the product does in fact work, i dont use it
much and my blackheads dont seem to come as fast anymore so i like this. The
packaging is cute and minimal so thats a plus. I wouldnt buy it again though.

Case: 9
Predicted: Negative
Ground truth: Negative

Tingled my skin quite a bit. After rinsing off my skin felt dry but moisturized
and smooth. I didn’t really see or feel a difference in the texture or
appearance of my skin though.

Ground truth: Negative

These are awesome! Not only is the color so much prettier than the solid gold,
they really do immediately brighten. The foil does a good job of keeping in heat
~ I love trying various eye masks and these are one of my favorites. Would
definitely rebuy Baggage Claim (currently using Bliss holographic (amazing!!)
and have ordered Erno Lazlo to try next)
